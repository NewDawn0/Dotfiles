## Tiling window manager
As the tiling window manager I'm using [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai).
Yabai is a tiling window manager made for mac. It's similar to i3 or bspwm.

## Hotkey dameon
As my hotkey dameon I'm using [shkd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)(simple hotkey dameon) made by the creator of yabai.

## Colorscheme
The colorscheme I'm currently using on most of my apps and CLI tools is the [catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) colorscheme. I use it in iTerm, Spotify, Neovim, VSCode, Übersicht widgets, Shell Prompt and in some wallpapers.

## Terminal
I switched to [iTerm](https://iterm2.com) about 8 months ago because I needed a true color terminal. The font I'm using is the [Liga SFMono Nerd Font](https://github.com/shaunsingh/SFMono-Nerd-Font-Ligaturized) together the terminal and the font make a great combination.

## Spotify config
In my opinion Spotifys UI is a bit bland boring. Which is why installed [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app). Spicetify allows you to change spotify using Js and Css.

## zshrc
My zshrce is pretty straight forward just some aliases, paths and some other stuff. For convenience I made my self an alias to quickly edit my zshrc file with vim no matter where I am in my file system.

## .profile
My the .profile is an rc file that gets executed on login
In my .profile I mostly have some minor stuff that needs to get executed not too often otherwise I'd propably of put it in my zshrc.

## Übersicht widgets
Some widgets
